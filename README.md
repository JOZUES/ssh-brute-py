A simple and educational brute-force SSH login tool built using Pythonâ€™s `pwntools` and `paramiko`.  
It tests a list of passwords against an SSH server to find valid credentials.

---

##  Features

- Uses `pwntools.ssh()` for simplified SSH connection
- Line-by-line wordlist scanning
- Input-based configuration (host, user, wordlist)
- Handles exceptions cleanly

---

## Requirements

```bash
pip install pwntools paramiko

python3 sshbruteforce.py
```
Then enter:

Host (e.g. 127.0.0.1)

Username (e.g. root)

Wordlist path (e.g. /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt)
